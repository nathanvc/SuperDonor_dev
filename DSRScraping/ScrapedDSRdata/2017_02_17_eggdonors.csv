Eggs were retrieved early December, 2003 from hispanic/chilean donor (Donor 801, 5'10, hispanic/chilean, cosmetologist).  It was a shared cycle.  We do not know the recipient of the other half of the eggs.  The recipient of the other half of the eggs did not conceive with their fresh cycle in December, 2003, but we believe they did conceive sometime in 2004 with frozen embryos from that donation.   Donor donated to other recipients prior to December, 2003.  Those recipients may have conceived also.  The donor does not have any children of her own.  We would like to share information with the parents of any of our daughter's half-siblings.

Otis (College of Art & Design), 2001-2005, Fine Arts.  Graphic designer (current in '08) Prev: illustrator, photographer, teacher.  Catholic.  I believe she has 2 sisters, was living in Oregon at the time of the egg donation but later moved back to California (I believe she went to college in California).  Very healthy, no posted medical issues of any type, although I recall there was a mention of eczema (though I can't find it when looking through her medical history that we received from the clinic).  Our daughter does have eczema and neither my husband nor I have any history of it in our families.  We had an email address for her, but it is not current (mail comes back undeliverable).  Overall, she was very healthy, definitely loved the arts (photography, graphic design, music, singing) and animals and travel and food. At the time of her posting to Oregon Reproductive Medicine, she had not been an egg donor previously.

Confirmed by genetic testing by medical/genetic laboratories and specialists. I am a carrier for Severe Combined Imunedefeciency (SCIDS), which is deadly to newborn baby males, X-linked, and autosominal recessive, although science is not clear on the specific variances of my genes...""unknown significance"", as to if this genetic variance may be autosominal dominant, as my children are now having sons, the gene is indeed being passed onto my offspring.In addition to the SCIDS, I also have Common Variable Immunedefeciency (CVID), also genetic and prognosis is poor. Treatment is weekly plasma (blood) infusions from healthy donors. I am posting as I did not have a choice as to remain annonymous when originally donating.

Brown  Wavy hair.  Hazel eyes.  Fair complexion.  Bsn (Bachelor's in Nursing).  Former nurse.  Catholic.  I donated eggs twice, in 2004-05.  I donated at IVF AMERICA founded in part by Dr. Stanger, in Portchester/Rye New York, Westchester County.  The first recipient became pregnant with triplets on the first try.  I believe that  she got 23-25 eggs.  The children would have been born in 1995.     The second retrieval was split by 2 women, one of which became pregnant with twins.  I know nothing about the other.     Now that  these children are older, I thought that they might have some questions for me, or perhaps be curious about my background or anything else, really.  I know that I have wondered about them over the years.  I now have 4 young children of my own, and am more aware than ever, that they have some half siblings (genetically) out there somewhere.     I have always been an exceptionally healthy person, and I continue to remain so.  I'm happy that I have that to contribute to these children.  I'm 5'7"", and have a very muscular build.  I have hazel green/gold eyes, and golden brown thick wavy hair.  My skin burns, and then deeply tans, and retains the tan for a lengthy time.  I love to help people, in small ways to very big.  I'm humbled that a family was made because of a part that I played.  I would very much like to hear from any of the children born from my egg donation.  I'm here, open and ready to answer any questions you may have, or to appease any curiosity you may have had over the years.

Christian.  I am currently a 23 year old college student with a love for fashion and design.When I was younger I was very shy and had a hard time with public speaking. My favorite classes were Math and Literature and I always had good grades.While growing up I tried most sports including basketball, soccer, softball and track. Basketball was and still is my favorite sport and I played competitively all the way through High School with a chance to take it to college but chose to attend an Art school instead.Now that I am older I have a very outgoing laid back personality and love to talk to people. My friends would consider me to be the most understanding and loyal friend they have because they know I never judge and I would do anything for those in my life.I started donating at age 22 and am very blessed to be able to help couples have a family they always dreamed of. I am very willing to answer any and all questions if it helps you understand things better.I hope this little ""About me"" post finds you well.Good luck :).

Let me say, everyone I spoke with while trying to find the records was so helpful and so sincere.  I told them straight up I was interested in finding the half siblings of my children.  That might sound strange, but in 1997 everything was completely anonymous.  And, as such, they gave me no information other than my Donor ID number (#73).

She is estranged from her birth mother and very much wants to connect to her biological mother...her egg donor.  I cannot find a contract anywhere and the fertility specialist who guided us through all of this in the summer of 1999 has no records and does not seem to be able to help us.  We are in Los Angeles.  My daughter's mother seems to remember that the donor's name was Melanie Gordon.  A few days ago she said she wasn't sure about the last name.  I remember that Melanie was Jewish of Russian or some sort of European/Slavic background.  I think she had brown hair.  The rest is a bit of a blur.  I have found one donor on the databasethat could be Melanie!  My daugher is doing beautifully in school and with lots of friends.  However, she really needs to make contact with you Melanie.  It is a sense of knowing who she is...where she came from...a female identity...that is missing from her life. If anyone out there can be of assistance in finding Melanie, we would be so grateful.Thank you,Harris. |Parent|['Girl born Mar 3, 2000']|10002869|15700|09/30/15|09/30/15|Hashore12|Southern California Reproductive Center|337|1|0|0|1|Mar 3, 2000|2

1093|unknown| I am at risk for Huntington's Disease. We decided to have children via donor eggs rather than risk passing the HD gene on. We have 3 beautiful daughters (donor egg/husband's sperm). BUT, my daughters would like to have the other half of their medical history. I got pregnant at the University of Cincinnati Center for Reproductive Health in August, 1989. The story at the time was that the donor was a nurse, her husband was a medical student and they already had two children. The donor had a friend who was going through infertility and when her husband was doing his ob/gyn rotation he learned about the new Donor Egg program that UC was trying to start. His wife decided to be part of the program. That story may or may not be true. It is what we were told.  So, THANK YOU. But, my girls would love to have as much info as you are willing to share. One of my girls thinks she would like to donate eggs herself but she needs a complete medical history.  They are wonderful women. They thank you and we thank you. |Parent|['Girl born May 1990', 'Girl born May 1990', 'Girl born May 1993']|31575|12962|05/08/13||Thankuforourfamily|University of Cincinnati|165|3|0|0|3|['May 1990', 'May 1990', 'May 1993']|2
